# 🔐 Cybersecurity Lab: Advanced Persistence Demonstration

> **⚠️ EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY | CONTROLLED LAB ENVIRONMENT | NOT FOR MALICIOUS USE**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This educational demonstration showcases advanced persistence techniques through a seemingly innocent Snake game. The project illustrates how malicious code can be hidden within legitimate applications and establish persistent remote access.


## 🚨 Critical Disclaimer

**BEFORE ACCESSING ANY CODE, READ THIS CAREFULLY:**

> 🛑 **FOR EDUCATIONAL & DEFENSIVE SECURITY PURPOSES ONLY**  
> 🛑 **ALL RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN ISOLATED VIRTUAL MACHINES**  
> 🛑 **DO NOT USE ON UNAUTHORIZED SYSTEMS**  
> 🛑 **UNDERSTANDING THESE TECHNIQUES HELPS BUILD BETTER DEFENSES**  
> 🛑 **ALWAYS PRACTICE RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE**  
> 🛑 **BRIDGE NETWORKING IS DANGEROUS - USE HOST-ONLY NETWORKS**
